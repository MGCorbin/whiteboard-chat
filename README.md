# Whiteboard Chat
This project creates two windows - a "send" window and a "receive" window. The aim of the project was to send data between these two windows using GPIO pins.

Originally this was meant to be a pairs project using two Raspberry Pi's. Due to covid, it was changed to be an individual project using virtual GPIO pins - simulated using booleans for the communication.

This project was developed using Qt.d
